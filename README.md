This is the website code for Steven Bock.

By continuing to read this code, you agree to hold Steven Bock completely responsible for the abomination that this code is.

...Seriously, this code is garbage. I should have used 
- ~~React~~
- ~~Vue~~
- ~~Squarespace~~
- ~~Angular~~
- ~~Ember~~
- ~~Meteor~~
- ~~Bootstrap~~
- ~~Backbone~~
- ~~A Google+ Page~~
- ~~Flask~~
- ~~Node.js~~
- ~~AJAX~~
- ~~jQuery~~
- ~~Django~~
- ~~A MySpace Page (too soon?)~~
- ~~Java Servelet Pages (JSP)~~
- ~~Geocities~~
- ~~Common Gateway Interface (CGI)~~
- Microsoft Frontpage
