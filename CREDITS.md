  - WHAT WAS USED
    - General file layout for Jekyll
  - WHY
    - Needed to learn how Jekyll uses header/footer templating as well as post layouts. Official Jekyll docs weren't cutting it.
  - CHANGES FROM ORIGINAL WORK
    - Almost everything really. Only really used it to learn about how Jekyll's theme and templating systems work on an abstract level.  ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
